	I watched the one you recommended and one of the takeaways I got was how little someone’s identity was actually
	worth to identity thieves.  The idea that one can purchase all the credit card info you need to purchase anything only
	goes for about 5 bucks is shocking. I wonder if it’s because it’s too risky for these sellers to use the info,
	or if they can easily acquire so many people’s info that there would be no way for them to use all of them.
